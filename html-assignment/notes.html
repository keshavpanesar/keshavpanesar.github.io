    <h1>Progress report of Keshav Singh Panesar</h1>
    There are 5 tags which I learnt in the first month of my Web Development I.<br>
    <dl>
        <dt>Heading tag:</dt>
        <dd>This tag is used to make heading for our content. There are total of 6 headings going from <br>
            h1,h2... to h6. In which h1 is most important and biggest heading and h6 is for least important and <br> smallest heading.</dd>
        <dt>Image tag:</dt>
        <dd>This is a singular tag used to insert image in HTML file. It has 2 parts which are <br>
            src and alt. SRC is used to insert the path of image, and alt is used to give a brief <br> description about image for 'picture of keshavsinghpanesar'</dd>
        <dt>Strong tag:</dt>
        <dd>This tag is used to make the text bold which highlights the text to make it look <strong>important.</strong></dd>
        <dt>Superscript and Subscript Text:</dt>
